# Pancake-House

Pancake-House is a website for a restaurant in Gothenburg, Sweden. It will help customers to hopefully choose pancake-house for their next restaurant-visit. It targets hungry customers who want to eat something simple, yet delicious, in the inner city of Gothenburg. Pancake-house is useful to cusomers because they can easily find the menu, they can read about the restaurant and how they only use local and organic products, book a table and find were the restaurant is located on a google map.

## Existing features

- __Navigation Bar__
- The website has a navigation bar which is full responsive and includes four links to the Logo, Home page, Menu and Book a table page. It is identical on all three pages for easy navigation.
- The user can easily navigate between the pages without having to revert back to previous pages via the "back"-button.

- __Landing page image__
- The landing includes an image with a pile of pancakes, overlayed with the text "DELICIOUS AND HOMEMADE!", it also contains the text "Since 1992".
- This quickly grabs the users attention and they will scroll down and look for more information.

## Features left to implement

- On the "Book A Table" page i want to add an input which allows the user to specify which time they will arrive to the restaurant.

## Design

- __Typography__
- Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
- Raleway is used for the body text on the site, it is a sans-serif font.
- Bricolage Grotesque is used for headings on the site, it is a sans-serif font.

- __Colour__
- I used this color scheme on the website. I think the palette goes well with the theme and gives a friendly impression to the user.
